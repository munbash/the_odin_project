 ## Regular Reading of the Quran 
<p> It is reported that <em> Uthman bn Affan </em>
Allah be pleased with him said: </p>
<p> I do not like it that a day or night comes upon 
    without me looking at the speech of Allah, i.e 
    reading from the <strong> mashaf</strong></p>
<em> Imam Ahmad, Al-Zuhd </em> </header>

<main><p> It is narrated on the authority of <em> Amir al-Mu'minin (Leader of the Believers)</em>, 
    <strong> Abu Hafs 'Umar bin al-Khattab</strong> (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: 
    <p> I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), say
     <em> Actions are according to intentions, and everyone will get what was intended.
         Whoever migrates with an intention for Allah and His messenger, the migration 
         will be for the sake of Allah and his Messenger. And whoever migrates for 
         worldly gain or to marry a woman, then his migration will be for the sake
          of whatever he migrated for.</em></p>
