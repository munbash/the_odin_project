>### The Odin Project

>> This project includes the development of my portfolio on the Odin project website.
> The repository is set up to highlight my progress through the basic and advanced web development courses.

 >> The repository serves as a portfolio of my work and serves to illustrate the abilities I develop by recording my learning, assignments, and projects as I move through the program.
